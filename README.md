## Problem

- Members of the LGBTQ+ community may face discrimination, harassment, and exclusion in their personal and professional lives, leading to social isolation and mental health issues.

- It can be difficult for individuals in the LGBTQ+ community to find resources and support, especially in areas where such resources are scarce or stigmatized.

- LGBTQ+ individuals may feel unsafe or uncomfortable in traditional social media spaces, where they may face hate speech, trolling, or doxxing.

- The LGBTQ+ community is diverse, with different experiences, needs, and interests, and there is a need for a platform that caters to this diversity and fosters connection and understanding.

## Solution
- Quinnn is a social media platform designed to connect and empower individuals in the LGBTQ+ community.

- This platform will serve as a safe and inclusive space for members of the LGBTQ+ community to connect, share resources, and find support. We hope to make a positive impact on the community and provide a valuable resource for those seeking to connect with others who share similar experiences.

## Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)
- Through Quinnn we are addressing two of the United Nations' [Sustainable Development Goals](https://sdgs.un.org/goals): 
    - Reduced Inequalities
    - Gender Equality 
- By providing opportunities for marginalized and underrepresented communities, we believe that we can contribute to a more equitable and just world. 
- Our initiatives aim to bridge the gap between different communities and create a more inclusive society where everyone has an equal opportunity to thrive. Through our efforts, we hope to make a positive impact on the world and inspire others to join us in our mission for equality and sustainability.
